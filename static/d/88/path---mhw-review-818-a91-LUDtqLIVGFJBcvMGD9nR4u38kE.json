However, ever since its inception and first showcase, die-hard fans of the series have judged the game’s new features with a grain of salt out of fear that the new mechanics would “taint” the purity and soul of their beloved franchise. Nevertheless, regardless of whether the game did or didn’t break the mold, its resounding financial success definitely proved that the formula works and that new games in the same vein could be a feasible endeavor for Capcom to pursue in future releases.</p>\n<p>However, does Monster Hunter World truly live up to the legacy of its forefathers? Is it really the resounding success that the game’s sales would otherwise make you think? Let’s dive in and see!</p>\n<p>Before getting on with the review, I feel it necessary to disclaim that I’m by no means a hardcore veteran of the series. I’ve known about Monster Hunter ever since its alleged glory days on the PSP. Furthermore, I played it for a bit on the Wii during Monster Hunter Tri’s apex.</p>\n<p>At the time, I was, admittedly, a two-bit scrub. I remember my first encounter with the Great Jaggi vividly. I recall telling myself in awe: “Wow, this AI is amazing” as the smaller Jaggis circled around their alpha male and my hunter, forming a makeshift arena where we would square down for the following 40 or so minutes (did I mention I was a scrub?). However, I’ve since honed my hunting/gathering skills after acquiring Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate on the 3DS, and then Monster Hunter Generations on the same console. I must’ve put in about 400 to 500 hours on both titles combined which, while it could be considered a sizeable amount of time, it’s actually not that much compared to the vets that put in thousands of hours in the game, and know it like the back of their hands.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I feel knowledgeable and confident enough to put pen to paper, so to speak, and give my honest, and hopefully objective opinion on the latest installment in this amazing franchise.</p>\n<h3>What is it?</h3>\n<p>In a few words; Monster Hunter World is a stellar game. If you’re a fan of the series, you are definitely missing out if you haven’t given this title a spin.</p>\n<p>However, for those of you who are not familiar with the game, or don’t conform to my crude ways of abruptly shilling it, then please read on.</p>\n<p>Monster Hunter World first released on January 26, 2018, on the PS4 and Xbox One to the joy of many fans, and the dismay of those who loved the series, yet only owned a gaming PC. I acquired it on launch since I got a decent $20 discount on a digital version of the game even though I knew in my heart of hearts that I would purchase it again when it came out on PC.</p>\n<p>August 9th marked the release day of the game on PC which, of course, I picked up day one and have been playing it religiously to this day. I’ve played around 300 hours between my PS4 and PC versions which, again, is really not that much, but it is more than enough to get through all of the game’s short content (more on that later). I have around 180 hours on PC, and have completed several endgame sets for several weapons, decorations included. I am still missing several augments, but it’s only a matter of time until I get there.</p>\n<p>With that being said, let’s begin with the game’s stronger points.</p>\n<h3>According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful</h3>\n<p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad\nCommas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text\ndidn’t listen.

And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using\nher. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and\nConsonantia, there live the blind texts.</p>\n<h4>Silent delightfully including because before one up barring chameleon</h4>\n<p>Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a\nlarge language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and\nsupplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in\nwhich roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>\n<p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an\nalmost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the\nname of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox\nadvised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild\nQuestion Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen.</p>\n<h5>Wherever far wow thus a squirrel raccoon jeez jaguar this from along</h5>\n<p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on\nthe way.
